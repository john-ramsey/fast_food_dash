# [2021 Los Angeles Fast Food Dashboard](https://ff-dashboard.johnramsey.com/)

This project utilizes SafeGraph location data to show visit trends in the 2021 year for various fast food brands in Los Angeles. Through hover responsive callbacks and Uber's H3 "geo-hexes" the data can be analyized at a more precise geographic level.

The repository consists of:
- **main.py** which initializes and lays out the dashboard as well as operates the callbacks
- **components.py** provides helper functions and classes which make the objects on the dashboard
- **metrics.csv** and **brands.csv** sudo databases represented as comma separated values for easy manipulation
- **Dockerfile** provided for easy image building
- **data/** summarized data files of selected SafeGraph data fields. Please note this data has been modified for the purposes of this project.
- **docs/** project & code documentation

## Features

- Hover Responsive Callbacks with H3 Geo-Hexes
